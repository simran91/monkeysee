# MonkeySee

MonkeySee is a simple program to load up images and get them as RGBA matrices.

We can then modify the values (or generate our own new RGBA matrix) and create an image from it.

The intention behind this program is that, in the future i hope to write some gimp plugins that can do
thigs like "seam carving" (also known as "liquid rescaling") and other funky plugins, and this codebase
will come in handy then :) 

The name MonkeySee comes from the phrase "Monkey See, Monkey Do" - in our case, Monkey See, and i'll write
mods for the "Do" part (although of course, you can easily write your own mods too :) 

The file/directory structure is as follows: 

* Makefile - for basic things like formatting the code, pushing it up to github, running main.go, etc
* main.go - This file runs all the mods to produce sample output showing us what each mod does
* mods/ - In this directory we have "mods" (small snippets that use the core to produce output such as a gaussian blur image). This is more an "example" directory to see how the core engine is used. 
* monkey/ - The core engine files are stored in this directory
* samples/ - In this directory is the input sample images and all the autogenerated output images (generated via main.go when running each mod)
* util/ - Utility functions (such as logging, etc)

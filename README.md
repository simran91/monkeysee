# monkeysee

Monkeysee is a simple program to load up images and get them as RGBA matrices.

We can then modify the values (or generate our own new RGBA matrix) and create an image from it.

The intention behind this program is that, in the future i hope to write some gimp plugins that can do
thigs like "seam carving" (also known as "liquid rescaling") and other funky plugins, and this codebase
will come in handy then :)
